# <center>Shandong Provincial University Contest on Intelligent Robotic Innovations Award</center>  

We won one First Prize, three Second Prizes, and two Third Prizes at the **Shandong Provincial University Robotics Competition**.

The **Shandong Provincial University Robotics Competition** was the first time our robotics lab team participated, competing in golf, racewalking, and dance events. From scratch, we overcame various challenges in programming, path planning, and motion control. In the golf event, the robots demonstrated precise motion control; in the racewalking event, stable walking was achieved through gait analysis; and in the dance event, the robots showcased flexible and graceful dance moves. This competition not only highlighted our technical strength and innovative capabilities but also laid the foundation for future competitions.
