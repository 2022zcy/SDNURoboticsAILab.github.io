# <center>IYAIC Award</center>  

We won two National First Prizes and three National Second Prizes at the **International Youth Artificial Intelligence Competition**.

In the 2023 **International Youth Artificial Intelligence Competition**, our team excelled in the NAO Golf Competition and the NAO Relay Race. Notably, in the NAO Golf Competition, our team achieved first place thanks to the NAO robot's flexible limbs and precise control, and we won a brand-new NAO robot awarded by SoftBank. In the NAO Relay Race, we overcame challenges such as gait analysis, vision correction, and communication technology, showcasing the limitless possibilities of robots in sports competitions and fully demonstrating our technical strength and innovative capabilities.
