# <center>Robotics Innovation Camp by CYL Award</center>  

We won one National Second Prize at the **Robotics Innovation Camp by CYL**.

Our innovative project, "AI-Guided Instruction-Generating Companion Robot", integrates Iflytek Xinghuo 2.0 model, NAO robot technology, and embodied intelligence-related technologies, aiming to provide intelligent companionship for children and the elderly. It generates control commands through voice instructions and responds to users' emotions, offering services such as rehabilitation training, medication management, and emotional support. Through sensor fusion, motion control, and human-computer interaction technology, the robot can perceive and respond to environmental changes in real-time, demonstrating excellent adaptability and intelligence. This project won one National Second Prize.
