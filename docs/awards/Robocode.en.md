# <center>Robocode Award</center>  

We won one First Prize and six Third Prizes at the **Robocode**.

In the **Robocode**, our team demonstrated exceptional programming skills and strategic abilities through the Robocode programming game. The competition was based on the Robocode platform using the Java programming language. Participants had to write code to control virtual tanks in battles, which tested not only programming skills but also algorithm design and artificial intelligence techniques. In 2023, the tanks we programmed performed excellently amid fierce competition, successfully defeating all opponents and earning the competition's highest honor.
